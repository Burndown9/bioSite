    <h1>About Richard</h1>
    <blockquote>When death reaches out to grab your hand, you can control your last
      words, but you can't control your last thoughts.</blockquote>
      <p class="ignore-css">Richard Hayes</p>
      <h2>Youth and Military Service</h2>
    <p>
      Richard Hayes was born on August 12, 1971 to parents John Richard Hayes and Mary 
      Hayes in Thomas Hospital in Akron, Ohio. When he was four years old, his parents
      divorced, and when Richard was six, his father remarried Susan Galehouse.
      Richard barely remembers Mary, and considers Susan to be his real mother.   
      Richard's father had broken Hayes tradition by refusing to name his eldest
      son John, and wanted to prevent Richard from following the Hayes tradition
      of being in the military. John himself had served in Vietnam, a scene that
      caused him to denounce the armed forces entirely. Richard was determined to
      serve his country, however.
      Since John wouldn't allow Richard to serve (and parental consent was needed
      to join the military before one was 18), Richard attended Kent State University
      in Ohio for one year. Dead set on joining the military, Richard did not put
      much focus on his academic career, ending the year with a 2.0 GPA on disciplinary
      and active probation.
      Once Richard was 18, he enlisted with the Navy as an electrician, serving in
      Operation Desert Storm as part of an elite tiger team of specialists to undermine
      the Iraqis' oil trade. After 5 years in the Navy, Richard went on to join the 
      Army Reserve for 5 years in a medical capacity.

    <h2>Civilian Life and Love</h2>
    <p>
      While living in California, Richard leaned into his reputation as a brute, doing
      whatever he wanted. He remembers a story with an Alameda bartender: "I had my feet up
      on the barstool, like I always did, and this bartender barks at me 'Get your feet
      down, you don't own this place'. I was shocked she was talking to me, because
      <i>no one</i> talked to me that way." They began dating soon after that, and on
      April 27, 1997, Richard married Catherine Witherby in Richard's home state
      of Ohio. Catherine quickly became pregnant, and Richard worked three part time
      jobs to provide for the family. Eventually, Richard found his true calling - a 
      factory job for the Little Tikes manufacturing company.
