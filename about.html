      <h2>Youth and Military Service</h2>
    <p>
      Richard Hayes was born on August 12, 1971 to parents John Richard Hayes and Mary 
      Hayes in Thomas Hospital in Akron, Ohio. When he was four years old, his parents
      divorced, and when Richard was six, his father remarried Susan Galehouse.
      Richard barely remembers Mary, and considers Susan to be his real mother.   
      Richard's father had broken Hayes tradition by refusing to name his eldest
      son John, and wanted to prevent Richard from following the Hayes tradition
      of being in the military. John himself had served in Vietnam, a scene that
      caused him to denounce the armed forces entirely. Richard was determined to
      serve his country, however.
      Since John wouldn't allow Richard to serve (and parental consent was needed
      to join the military before one was 18), Richard attended Kent State University
      in Ohio for one year. Dead set on joining the military, Richard did not put
      much focus on his academic career, ending the year with a 2.0 GPA on disciplinary
      and active probation.
      Once Richard was 18, he enlisted with the Navy as an electrician, serving in
      Operation Desert Storm as part of an elite tiger team of specialists to undermine
      the Iraqis' oil trade. After 5 years in the Navy, Richard went on to join the 
      Army Reserve for 5 years in a medical capacity.

    <h2>Civilian Life and Love</h2>
    <p>
      While living in California, Richard leaned into his reputation as a brute, doing
      whatever he wanted. He remembers a story with an Alameda bartender: "I had my feet up
      on the barstool, like I always did, and this bartender barks at me 'Get your feet
      down, you don't own this place'. I was shocked she was talking to me, because
      <i>no one</i> talked to me that way." They began dating soon after that, and on
      April 27, 1997, Richard married Catherine Witherby in Richard's home state
      of Ohio. Catherine quickly became pregnant, and Richard worked three part time
      jobs to provide for the family. Eventually, Richard found his true calling - a 
      factory job for the Little Tikes manufacturing company. Eventually, Catherine
      found him a nursing job to take advantage of his medical background. Jacob
      Hayes was born January 27, 1998, and Anne Hayes was born June 12, 2000.
      In the 2000s, Richard had gotten fed up with the ignorance he found himself
      surrounded by: "The final straw was when I was helping an RN with her new
      admission and I said, 'You might want to take a look at this, because it says
      he's allergic to NSAIDs but he's on Tylenol,' and she says 'Tylenol's not an
      NSAID.' So I take it to the doctor and he goes, 'Tylenol's not an NSAID.'"
      After this encounter, Richard began attending Fortis College to become a
      Registered Nurse, and graduated in the late 2000s.

      <h2>Later Life and Health</h2>
      <p>
        As Richard grew older, his health began to deteriorate, with consistent seizures
        caused by epilepsy, as well as the onset of emphysema in the late 2010s.
        He was also diagnosed with psychosis and schizophrenia, and placed on medication
        to help control these conditions. In 2021, an X-Ray spotted multiple growths in 
        his lungs, likely cancerous.
